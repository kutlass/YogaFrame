YogaFrame 1-pager
=================

Do the BARE MINIMUM feature set. Shipping SOMETHING is critical critical **critical**. Come November ~~3rd~~ [10th](https://www.yogaframe.net/?p=442) 2014, ship what you have. This is non negotiable.

Overview
--------
YogaFrame will be an app with frame data driven solely by the community. There will be no single  gatekeeper of the frame data. Community members can "Be the first to submit Dudley's c.MP!"

Integrity and accuracy of all community data will be a self correcting organism where users Vote Up or Vote Down a given data element. ALL data elements will be treated in this fashion, even the description of a given SF Character.

Unity3D will be leveraged for app implementation. This facilitates cross platform development for iPhone, Android, Windows Phone and so on.

YogaFrame will be FREE. Monetization will instead consist of an unobtrusive ad system in the app, and a PayPal donation button at yogaframe.net's website.

Pillars
-------
* Fast
  * Speed is EVERYTHING, like a reference app should be.
  * An EVO pro can reliably unsheathe this app as a strategic companion. Think Cortana.
  * Zero load time
  * Entire app loaded into memory
  * Snappy UI. Zero hiccups in transitions.
  * Asynchronous UI and network IO
* Intuitive
  * Brain dead ease of use
  * Text based minimalist UI
  * No visual bloat
  * Most relevant data at forefront
* Small
  * Tiniest possible storage footprint thanks to text UI. Under 10 megs should be possible. Only obstacles would be middleware bloat.
  * Quick download
  * Frame Data centric
  * Frame data always at forefront of UX
  * No matter what V.Next features I make, it will not be at the expense of burying the accessibility of frame data
